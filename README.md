## Personal Website

My personal website for career, showcasing projects, and anything else that fits. :-)

---

Built with React (bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)).

### Setup

`yarn install` or `npm install`

### Build

`yarn build` or `npm run build`

### Run locally

`yarn dev` or `npm run dev`
Once above command is finished, go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser (unless you've set this up differently).
